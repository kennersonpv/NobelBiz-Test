# Agent Script
Develop a web page that presents customer details within text boxes. Implement an automatic saving mechanism for the
text boxes to store information without requiring manual intervention from the user. Beneath the customer information
section, include a concise script elucidating the purpose of the call. The length and content of this script can be
determined according to your discretion.
Additionally, integrate a table that dynamically retrieves information from an endpoint and showcases the data in tabular
format. The table should display specific items extracted from the endpoint. Furthermore, enable a functionality where
clicking on the description in the table opens the corresponding URL (obtained from the JSON result of the endpoint) in a
new tab.

Customer information to show:
- First name
- Last name
- CIty
- State
- Zip
- Company name

  
Data to show in table:
- Description
- Type
- Topics
- Can show all of these in one cell of the table
